It is thought to be mid to late nineteenth century.  This is partly due to the exterior design of the house.  It's sash windows are made with two panes of glass which was more common after the 1840's when technological developments produced glass in larger sheets. In addition the stained glass used in the larger arched window above the entrance is perhaps more in keeping with the later part of the century.  During the nineteenth century there was a revival in the use of stained glass especially in Gothic design and later in the Art Nouveau style. Finally, the interior of the house is very similar to the Amy Miles House of 1890 in the Bethnal Green Museum of Childhood.  They both have thirteen rooms that vary only slightly in their configuration and social function.  At some stage the house was fitted with electric lighting possibly reflecting this technological development in real homes.  The interior has some fitted furniture with fireplaces in five rooms, a range and dresser in the kitchen and another dresser in the Butlers room.  In the Drawing room there is some intricate and impressive oak panelling.

In addition, the firm made every type of loom and a vast range of associated textile equipment until their closure in 1981.
Each loom was assembled at the Hattersley works in Keighley before being packed in order to ensure that all the parts worked properly. Then before dismantling, various parts of the loom were numbered and marked with paint in order to make it easier to assemble later. The loom was then placed in a crate - which on arrival at its destination was then unpacked and assembled with only reference to a simple guide.
The Hattersley standard loom was introduced in 1921 and was a huge success, which accounts for how many of these looms survive today. This particular loom was used at James Ives & Co. in Yeadon and has recently undergone a lengthy restoration project to prepare it for weaving our new, specially-designed 'Armley Weave' cloth on site at Armley Mills."

It was common for pedestrians, horses and carriages to cross the lines wherever and whenever they wanted. The inevitable increase in accidents saw a call for bridges to be erected over the new lines.
Initially, wooden bridges were preferred for the cheapness of their construction but it became increasingly aware that iron would be necessary to bridge the ever-increasing spans and take the increasing loads. This bridge, number No. 93a - also known as 'Halfpenny Bridge' from its time as a toll bridge - was the first cast iron footbridge on the entire British railway network. 
Cast in six sections by Beecroft & Butler at the Kirkstall Forge in Leeds for the Great Northern Railway, the bridge was originally erected just north of Retford and was later moved to Todds Green, between Stevenage and Hitchin. The footbridge has a fish-bellied main frame with vertical members extending to hold horizontal wrought iron tension bars.  Wrought iron parapet base also attached, with box frame and cross members to support a timber deck. The total span of the bridge is 52ft with a 5ft rise.

- The 'Organum Ptolemei' is a close cousin to the 'de Rojas' astrolabe, though it has a rotating orthographic plate without the neccesary","This instrument is the only known example in the world of an ?Organum Ptolemei? being found on the same instrument as a quadrant. It dates to the 16th Century and features two inscriptions to the obverse that both read ?Thomas Cock?. Though nothing is known about Thomas Cock, it is presumed that he was the one-time owner of the instrument rather than its creator as one inscription looks to have been done by an amateur ? possibly Cock himself - while the other is a more purposeful, professional inscription of a later date. Cock was likely a wealthy individual to be able to afford to have the instrument made from brass. Working astrolabes were made from whatever materials were to hand so an instrument like this is as much an ostentatious show of wealth and education as it is a working navigational tool.
 
The Organum Ptolemei on the obverse is a close cousin to the 'de Rojas' astrolabe, though it has a rotating orthographic plate without the necessary orthogonal cursor. The instrument has a solar longitude scale in the margin and a divided regula. The ?sinical quadrant? on the reverse is a mathematical instrument used to simplify trigonometric calculations. It has lines inscribed in a grid. The ratio of the length of a given line to the quadrant's radius gives the sin or cosine of the corresponding angle. The arc and outer square edges are divided into degrees running in both directions 0-90. A plumb bob would have been suspended on a string from the hole in the corner.
 
Adjacent to the two inscriptions, at a perpendicular angle, is the crudely stamped number '17'. It is not currently understood what this refers to. Also, a reverse 'N' can be seen crudely but boldly engraved at 90 degrees on the orthographic plate. This is likely to be an aid to an inexperienced user of the instrument.
 
The Organum Ptolemei originally entered the city?s collections via the Leeds Philosophical and Literary Society in 1918 from the widow of the renowned collector of scientific instruments, William Sykes Ward."

""In 2009 I also contributed reviews to Leeds Music Scene (the foremost Leeds music website) and Vibrations, a freely distributed bi-monthly popular music magazine for Leeds. In 2009 I was again able to get a guest pass with access to the press tent. The guest campsite and catering area are relatively comfortable. This year my youngest son came with me to help with the running about. We cycled from Otley where I live (about 16 miles away) carrying tent, sleeping bags, food, laptop and cameras on our bikes. We arrived on Thursday, early enough to get our tent organised and walk down to what is now called The BBC Introducing Stage in time for a special pre-festival event curated by Leeds' Dance To The Radio record label. I spent the rest of the weekend (as usual) at the new talent stage, with occasional visits to other stages (especially to see Leeds bands). Wife Chris came over for the day on Saturday and we enjoyed Radiohead's headline set together. Over the weekend I saw performances by at least 50 artists. After three nights under canvas son Richard and I cycled back to Otley on a beautiful late-summer morning through rich Yorkshire countryside in a very good mood"".

""I have volunteered at Leeds Festival through Oxfam for the past three years, and 2010 was the best yet!  As arena crew, I think I get to see a different side to the festival.  Our campsite is small, quiet, and secure - a far cry from the muddy, cramped, and rowdy public campsites!  We are able to walk around the ""backstage"" route, which this year involved almost getting ran over by the ""We Are Scientists"" tour bus!"".

""Oxfam stewards work three 8-hour shifts over the course of the festival, which leaves plenty of time to enjoy the music.  This year, my role was scanning tickets on the way into the festival, meaning I was able to meet loads of punters - most of whom were really friendly.  We also work closely with security, which means the shifts are never dull!"".

""My personal musical highlights of the weekend were Bad Religion, Cypress Hill and Weezer.  The crowd, especially on the Saturday, seemed so happy to be there and enjoying the music, which had a nostalgic feel for the majority  - as the typical Leeds festival goer falls between the ages of 18 and 25, Blink 182 were a particular highlight, allowing us to recapture our early teens!"".

""After a whole week at the festival, it was a relief to get back to my home comforts - I don't think I have ever been so excited about having a shower!  However, the festival experience is completely unique, and I am sure I will be back next year for more music, fun and revelry!"".

""I wasn't intending to go to Leeds Festival at all this year because I wasn't bowled over by the line-up, plus I got married in June followed by an exotic Mexican honeymoon so money was tight.  But friends from Wales said they were going to Leeds Festival for one day and persuaded (very easily) both myself and my husband Stu to join them"".  

""So we got tickets for Friday 26th August.  In true Leeds Festival tradition, it decided to rain all day and I was actually glad I wasn't camping.  In terms of the Friday line-up, I was most excited to see Interpol, who I have seen several times before but they remain one of my favourite bands, but I wasn't too bothered about seeing anyone else - I just knew it would be a great atmosphere and a fun day spent with friends.  As usual the bands I wanted to see were spread over different days - I would have loved to go on the Saturday for Metronomy and The Vaccines, and the Sunday for Everything Everything and The National, plus crowd-pleasers Pulp and The Strokes, but I wasn't prepared to pay for a whole weekend ticket"".

""In the end we had a brilliant time in the rain and the mud.  I saw lots of bands that I wouldn't normally have gone to see; 'The Streets' for instance - (they were surprisingly good), followed by a band called 'F*cked Up' (not so good).  I managed to eat three portions of noodles and drink plenty of Gaymers cider, and finished off the day by dancing to Muse in the rain, which brought back memories of Leeds Festival 2006"".

It is made of cotton, tapestry woven on a small handloom. The main red band in the centre has a repeated design of birds in black, pink and natural, with borders of interlocking spirals or keys.  Attached to the top of this is an undyed area of plain woven fabric; at the bottom is a tapestry woven fringe. One end is quite tattered and torn.

Weaving in Peru goes back to 2000 B.C.  Techniques such as tapestry weaving have been practised for thousands of years.  Tapestry weaving produces a weft faced fabric.  This means that the yarns used for the weft can be seen on the front of the cloth, and the warp threads are usually not visible.  'Weft' is the term used for the yarns which pass from left to right across the loom.  The 'warp' yarns go from top to bottom.

In tapestry weaving, there are many separate wefts, one for each colour area.  These coloured weft threads are worked back and forth across the cloth, but only in the pattern area where they are needed.  They do not extend from selvedge to selvedge of the finished cloth.  In many tapestry woven textiles vertical splits can be seen in the cloth along the edges of pattern areas.  This is one way of helping to identify them as tapestry woven."

The banner is double-sided and was mainly used in processions. If it was on static display the pole would have to stand out from any wall it was fixed to, inside a temple building, or above a doorway, so that both sides could be seen. Below the casing are three flaps with a large gold character on each. These are the same on both sides and read 'Tai Ping She' which translates as '[Heavenly] Peace Society' or community. The main or central panel has two large appliqued characters, also of couched gold thread, which read 'Jin Gu' which means Golden Drum. On New Year a golden drum was transported through the village or community, beaten loudly, and the banner would have been held or fixed above it on the cart or sedan.  Repeated in the purple border is the character Xi meaning double happiness. 

Other references to New Year on the banner are the lions or lion dogs chasing balls in the bottom corners, commonly performed as a New Year dance. Smaller characters in the deep blue or purple border say 'Double Happiness' and ' Luck'. The four larger appliqued figures, two on each side, are four of the Eight Taoist immortals. One side has the flute player Han Xiangli, and a bearded scholar with a scholar's cap and a Taoist fly brush, Lu Dongbin.

Made of white-coloured, cured hide; has long sleeves decorated with rectangular panels of beadwork sewn over shoulders and on sleeves; glass beads ar","Sioux or Lakota beadwork can often be identified by the use of geometric, symmetrical designs on a white background.  Glass beads like the ones used on this shirt were imported to North America in huge quantities during the nineteenth century.  Beadwork eventually replaced traditional techniques such as quillwork.  Beads were available in many different colours.  Using them was less time consuming than using porcupine quills, which had to be dyed and flattened before they could be used.  

The beadwork on this shirt was carried out on separate pieces of leather and then applied.  The beads are sewn to the leather using 'lazy stitch'.  The thread passes through from the reverse side of the fabric and is threaded through several beads before stitching back down through the material.  The process continues in rows until the area to be beaded is covered.  This technique can often be identified by the appearance of ridges in the beadwork where the beaded thread has arched up slightly, away from the surface of the fabric or leather.  Four beaded bands decorate this shirt.  One runs across each shoulder, and there is a beaded band on each sleeve.  The bands are decorated with geometric patterns in green, light blue, dark blue, black, red and yellow, on a white ground.  

The shirt is T shaped, with the sleeves fitted at right angles to the body.  It is slit part of the way up each side seam.  The leather has been cut to give a notched zig zag edge all the way up each side seam, and at the cuffs.  The round neckline has an insert at the front, of a triangular panel of fabric which gives the effect of a V neckline.  The panel is made up from two smaller triangles of fabric, one blue and one red.  Some geometric patterned beadwork decorates the edge and middle of this insert, using red, black, light blue and yellow beads.  Leather fringing runs around the edges of the V shaped neck panel and along the bottom edges of all the beadwork panels."

The underskirt is of layered tattered brown felt.  It supports a full skirt in a shade of orange, with the hem printed with a folk art pattern in red.  Floral elements of this design are picked out with yellow embroidery to give an almost brocaded effect.  A distressed jumper is knitted with the same pattern in shades of pink and brown.  It is hooded and has exaggerated long sleeves.  

Over the top a brown satin bra with suede trim is worn.  The bra has a conical shape which echoes underwear styles of the 1950s.  Vivienne Westwood is well known for her reinterpretation of historic fashions in contemporary dress.  She was one of the originators of the idea of underwear as outerwear during the 1980s."

Opening, in 1870, the shop stood on the corner of Bond Street and Park Row, where a Lloyds bank stands today.  Marshall and Snelgrove was the Harvey Nichols of its day and was best known for selling upmarket fashions. 
 
The Leeds shop was one of many Marshall and Snelgrove stores across the country. The history of the firm can be traced back to 1837 and its first shop was situated on Vere Street, just off the highly fashionable Oxford Street, in London. One of the original founding partners of the firm was aYorkshire mann,named Mrr James Marshall. The firm had great success and opened up many branches outside of London, providing good quality goods for the rising rich Victorian middle classes.

In the late 1950s when this dress was purchased, Marshall and Snelgrove had merged with Debenham Freebody, another large firm. They continued to sell high end goods, however shopping trends had started to change and by the 1960s luxury stores such as Marshall and Snelgrove went into decline.  The firm had to close many of its stores including the Leeds shop, in 1973."

With its puffed sleeves and pretty ""cottage style"" fabric this jacket seems a little too traditional. However the inside of the jacket is lined with diamante studs, which press against bare skin in a sensual manner.  A closer look at the fabric also shows a print telling a story.  The sheperdess, from the story, seems to have lost her top, much to the delight of her companion.  So the jacket is actually rather subversive, and very punk.
The fabric used is a screen printed copy of a famous design for a 1700s printed cotton called ""Le Mouton Cheri"".  Such designs were considered slightly naughty and really only suitable for bedrooms. An original print of the design can be found in the Leeds Museums and Galleries Ginsburg collection of textiles. 
This jacket was purchased in June 2008 as part of Leeds Museums and Galleries policy of collecting British couture. It comes from the collection of Jerry Hall.

On the evening of 16th March 1941 Leeds Museum received a direct hit in one of the wartime bombing raids, devastating parts of the collection. The logboat was shattered into forty-five pieces. Each piece was carefully sifted from the debris, wrapped in sheets of the News Chronicle, and stored in a crate.
 
It wasn?t until 1974 that the fragments were re-examined with a view to reconstructing the vessel. The pieces were sent down to the National Maritime Museum at Greenwich to be researched, conserved and re-assembled.

As a result of the research done at Greenwich, we now know that the boat was made from a single ash tree and dates to around 1335 AD. It was designed to carry one person sitting on the D-shaped board, from which the boat could be propelled with a paddle. There was also some room for carrying cargo. It is likely that the boat was used to fish from the tarn.

The logboat was returned to Leeds Museums in 1988."

It was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1806 and is one of a few watercolours from this period which found a buyer. It has been suggested that the innovative execution of the subjects with daring disregard for finish, may have been the reason for Cotman's failure to gain membership of the Water-Colour Society in 1806.
A few years later the poet Sir Walter Scott also stayed with the Morritt family at Rokeby Park and was equally impressed with the fine view on the river Tees looking towards Barnard Castle. He wrote in his poem Rokeby:

Cotman had succeeded Girtin as the leader of the Sketching Society on the latter's death in 1802. The compositions, rapidly executed in an evening in monochrome and without the aid of sketches, were drawn from memory. This encouraged the intervention of the artist?s imagination in the portrayal of landscape.

Frame: 603  505mm","Drawing of man on horseback, two men on either side walk on foot caring long poles, three hounds run alongside group chasing a Hare. In the distance - a country house and surrounding grounds.","This drawing is typical of Barlow's work as an illustrator. The action takes place in the foreground with a strong diagonal composition countered by a static landscape backdrop. The main figures are highly finished and heavily outlined. 
The drawing was used as an illustration to Richard Blome's 'The Gentleman's Recreation' published in two parts in 1686. The second part contained thirty-eight full page illustrations and six in an oval format.  The contours of the figures and dogs have been scored with a stylus for transfer on to an etching plate. 
Barlow made sporting scenes his speciality and returned to this particular theme a number of times. There are drawings of the same subject in the British Museum, The Mellon Collection, the Ashmolean Museum, Christ Church, Oxford and Birmingham Art Gallery. 
In 'The Several Ways of Hunting, Hawking and Fishing according to the English Manner', published in 1671, Barlow's drawing, etched by Hollar, is accompanied by the verse:
The timorous Hare, when started from her seat,
by bloody hounds, to save her life soe sweet,
with several shifts, much terrour and great payne,
Yet dyes she by their mouths, all proves but vayne."

","This watercolour illustrating Job 42:8 is related to plate 20 (which takes verse 13-15 as its theme) in Blake's 'IIllustrations of the Book of Job' published in 1825. 
The subject of the Old Testament prophet, Job, had interested Blake since 1786 when he produced the etching 'The Complaint of Job'. In about 1805 he produced a series of studies from the book of Job for his patron Thomas Butts, the outlines of these were later traced by John Linnell, and Blake produced a second set from the tracings in 1821. It is thought that Butt's original set of illustrations did not include one from the last chapter and this was added later possibly after Linnell's version. The Leeds watercolour may be either a preliminary sketch for the Linnell drawing, or an intermediate study between the Linnell and Butt's version. The cruciform pose of Job reflects Blake's belief in the parallels between Job and Christ. 
This watercolour is a typical example of the freedom of line and wash associated with Blake's style."

Collet specialised in street affrays; here a donkey stumbles on the cobbles and is beaten by its master, while the ladies to the right cover their eyes in refined horror at the scene. The image includes an example of the 'Italians who came to sell plaster statuettes which they balanced on their heads', referred to by the artist Thomas Jones in his Rhyming Memories. The presentation of figures in the form of a tableau with no reference to the setting, and the sparing use of colour over shading in Indian ink wash, suggest that this drawing was originally conceived as the basis for an engraving."

Their work had become as impressive as artists working in oil paints. By this time the ruins of Kirkstall Abbey inspired artists' imaginations often because of their closeness to the new industrial scene. Here Fripp has shown the wide sweep of the Aire valley looking west towards Horsforth. The bucolic figures in the foreground, whose red jacket and cap provide the only touches of hot colour in the picture, act as a contrast to the dimly-glimpsed smoking chimneys in the background. These symbols of industry suggest that the peace of the valley is about to be overwhelmed.

The name ?Cistercian ware? refers to the finely thrown, glazed pottery first found on the sites of Cistercian abbeys in the north of England.  Despite its name, however, this pottery was not actually produced at Cistercian abbeys.  A number of secular sites in the north of England and the Midlands were making this type of pottery from the late 15th century right up until the 17th century, long after the Cistercian abbeys had closed down during the Dissolution of the Monasteries. 
A range of Cisterican ware sherds were discovered at Kirkstall Abbey in the 1890s when it was being cleared.  These sherds were from pots used by the last generation of monks living in the Abbey between about 1475 and 1539.

Floor tiles were probably made in mobile workshops which moved around to different sites in the region.

The etching shows a blockade of the church's West door, possibly erected to prevent access to a thoroughfare running through the centre of the church and closed in 1804. However the picture also shows water reaching right up to the church entrance suggesting flooding of the precinct (although no flood is recorded/ floods were recorded)
    Between 1803 and 1805 Cotman made three tours of Yorkshire where he visited his patrons, Mr and Mrs Cholmeley of Brandsby Hall. It is likely that it was during one of these trips that he first visited Kirkstall. On his return to Norfolk he issued his first series of etchings entitled 'Miscellaneous Etchings of Architectural Antiquities of York'. The figure on the far right of the image could be a depiction of the artist himself at work. 
      In the early part of the 19th century Cotman became a prominent member of the Sketching Club founded by the artist Thomas Girtin, also famous for his paintings of Kirkstall.

The bare earth floor is scattered with debris while the roots of trees and plants covering the building hang down from the ceiling. 
    In the 1920s the Crypt underwent extensive restoration in which late unsympathetic 19th century repairs to the entrance were replaced and the whole crypt was paved. 
    In the same year that this print was produced, illustrator James Duffield Harding employed Coney to produce a series of etchings documenting the cathedrals and abbeys of England. This included Kirkstall and it is likely that Coney completed this picture whilst visiting the Abbey for James Harding. The project took fourteen years to complete and was published in 1829 under the title 'Views of English Abbeys and Cathedrals'.

Dated May 1st 1777 it is the earliest existing painting of the Abbey by Griffiths. Griffiths was an amateur artist in the service of typographer and antiquarian Thomas Pennant of Downing in Flintshire. Pennant employed Griffiths to paint the most memorable places he visited whilst touring the country, describing him as 'a worthy servant I keep for that purpose'.

The painting is considered to be an accurate representation of Kirkstall Abbey at this time, despite the artist's reputation for romanticism. Here we see the Abbey from the North East, just two years before a large part of the Abbey church tower collapsed and was lost forever. The painting also shows how the church's East facade probably looked before repairs to the wall underneath the large East window. The existing ruins of the Abbots lodgings can be seen to the left hand side of the painting, missing are the ruins of the abbey infirmary which were not excavated nor even located for another . 
Another view of the abbey from the North West by Griffiths dated May 15th 1777 also survives as part of the Leeds Museums and Galleries Collection and is also held at Leeds City Art Gallery.

Nesyamun's coffin is the only Egyptian coffin in the world securely dated to the 20th Dynasty (to the reign of Ramesses XI).  His coffin was made especially for him showing he was a man of high rank (coffins for less important people were bought ready made with blank spaces left for their name).  This type of coffin comes from the cemeteries of Thebes and are usually associated with the priests of Amun.  Each person may have chosen their own decoration, perhaps from a range of designs.

The coffin was made of wood covered with gypsum plaster and then painted and probably varnished.  The back of the coffin was left undecorated, indicating that it was intended to lie on the floor facing upwards.  The inside was painted black.  The hands of the figure on the coffin lid would have originally held amulets, probably the tyet-knot and djed-pillar, representing Isis and Osiris, or short wands.  The face would also have had a short beard. These features have since been broken off.

Six scenes on the front of the coffin show Nesyamun making offerings to various deities, sometimes wearing a wig and sometimes with a shaven head.  The lower part of the coffin shows the gods associated with death and funerals.  The texts contain prayers to the gods and goddesses asking for success in the afterlife and contact with the gods.  The texts were written by one person in Middle Egyptian.  

Examples of coffin text:

Nesyamun requests 'bread for my body, breath for my nose, burial in the True Place, water for my soul, and onions at my neck the day of going round the walls'.  This relates to the procession during the festival of Sokar celebrating death .  Onions have often been found in mummy coffins or lists of offerings.

'Recitation by the revered one before Nephthys, sister of god, mistress of the west:  May she give all good and pure things to the Osiris, god's-father, scribe of the temple of Montu, lord of Thebes, Nesyamun, true-of-voice'. 

'May Nut stretch out her arms over my face, in this her name of the one who stretches out both arms, driving away darkness so she may make brightness arise in every place where I shall be on earth and in the cemetery.'"

The inscription itself was found on the island of Delos where representatives from Paros and Naxos came together at the court of Eretrian dikasts (judges).  

The earlier content of the settlement is lost, but what is left of the inscription translates as follows:

The settlement is now finally made
All further action between individuals barred, in respect of anything that arises out of the disputes now settled between the two cities
All action barred as against Naxos by Paros
All action barred as against Paros by Naxos
No claim of individuals against either city allowed

The date of the settlement in Eretrian, Naxian, and Parian reckoning
The Eretrians to keep an official copy of this settlement, and to forward sealed copies to the cities concerned
The representatives from Paros and Naxos are to convey to their respective cities the copy of this settlement

We do not know what the dispute was about but it may have been over something like fishing or trading rights - commerce was vitally important to the maritime states of Greece.  Paros appears to have been the victim, with Naxos having to pay a fine to Paros and Paros being ordered to spend some of the payment on sacrificing an ox to the Naxian god Dionysus.  But whatever the dispute was about, it was certainly temporary; heavy fines are threatened in the case of the settlement being broken by either party."

The Samaritan script on the stone lists the Ten Commandments.  Parts of the first and last sections of each is missing because the stone was broken, probably in the 14th century.  In translation it reads:

1??. to hallow it
2??..and thy mother
3??..commit adultery thou shalt not
4??..testify against thy neighbour??.
5??..covet the house of???
6??..covet the wife of thy neighbour

8  And thou shalt write on the stones (from Dt. ch.27, v.8).
9  this law plainly (from Dt. ch.27 v.8).
10 Law Moses commanded to us (from Dt. ch.33, v.4).

The stone was discovered around 1856 by a group of Samaritan workmen digging in the garden of a ruined mosque in Nablus.  It was then secretly carried to the house of their leader, Sheik Yakob esh Shellaby.

About this time the local tax collector stole all the tax they had paid, leaving them to pay their enormous tax bill for a second time.  They were unable to do this, with the result that a governor threw the Sheik into jail, where he was tortured by having the soles of his feet beaten with sticks.

Fortunately the British Consul was able to raise funds in London to pay the tax, and secure the Sheik's release.  In 1861 the Rev. Joseph Hammond of Leeds stayed with the Sheik while on a tour of the Holy Land.  The Sheik presented him with the Ten-Commandments stone for permanent protection and preservation in the Leeds Museum collection.  The stone arrived in Leeds in 1862, and 12 years later the Sheik came to Leeds to see his gift, and to tell the story of its discovery to the Museum staff.

In 1916 the work force numbered 16,000. As the war continued and the death rate on front increased male labour was gradually replaced by female labour until the Barnbow workforce comprised almost 93% women or girls.

Barnbow was also the scene of one of the worst tragedies in the history of the City of Leeds, although it was never reported at the time. 5th December 1916 there was a dreadful explosion that killed 35 women and girls, and many more were injured."

John Marshall was the son of a linen draper with a shop at No 1, Briggate, and a house in Mill Hill. In 1788 in partnership with Matthew Murray  he adapted cotton spinning machinery to spin flax into linen yarn.

In 1840?43 Marshall built a new mill, Temple Mill on Marshall Street which covers two acres. It was designed by the Architect Bonomi in the style of an Egyptian Temple. The roof was made of brick supported on iron columns, and had over sixty conical glass skylights, each 14ft in diameter and rising 10ft above the roof, providing excellent lighting for the factory. The brick roof was covered by a layer of plaster, and then waterproofed with a layer of lime and coal tar. This was then protected by eight inches of soil, sown with grass seed. The surface was drained through the hollow iron columns supporting the roof. It is said that to keep the grass short, sheep were put to graze on the roof!

Underneath the factory were a brick-vaulted cellar which housed the engines for powering the spinning machinery, and a ventilation system which kept the air at a constant temperature and humidity (which can be seen in this print). There were also tradesmen's shops and private baths for the use of the mill workers. A second building with a faade in the style of the Egyptian Temple at Edfu was built two years later to house the mill offices.

The building still survives and is used as offices.

A year before, Isabella had become the second wife of Francis, Viscount Beauchamp, later second Marquess of Hertford.  Isabella made connections with the very highest of English society becoming chief confidante of the Prince of Wales.  This followed the Minnie Seymour Case.  Minnie was the niece and legal guardian of Lord and Lady Hertford after her parent?s death.  However, she was also a favourite of the Prince of Wales and his wife Mrs Fitzherbert and a playmate of their daughter Charlotte.  At the Princes persuasion Minnie was relinquished to Mrs Fitzherbert, for whom it was said afterwards that she 'won a daughter but lost a husband.'  
Lady Hertford had the reputation of a woman of utmost propriety and her role may, therefore, have been more as mother and confidante to the Prince helping him with his entertaining of, amongst others, Allied Sovereigns. 
However, Isabella began to meddle in politics on behalf of the Tory Party for which she became the subject of satire in the popular press.  By 1820 the Prince had tired of Isabella who was replaced in his affections by Lady Conyngham.
Under the terms of the 9th Viscount's will, Temple Newsam was to be inherited by Isabella's husband then her second son or , failing that, to the 9th Viscount's surviving daughters and their sons in order of seniority.

By then he had married, in 1758, one of London's wealthiest heiresses Frances Gibson Shepheard of which there is also a portrait (ticket no.366) in the State bedroom painted by Sir Joshua Reynolds.  Frances was the daughter of Samuel Shepheard who was a successful business man and landowner with a parliamentary career that lasted nearly 50 years. Upon her fathers death Frances inherited a fortune of 60,000.  A portrait of Samuel Shepheard (ticket no. 89) can be seen in the Picture Gallery.  This newly acquired wealth paid off the mortgage on the property, bought new silver, china and furniture and funded the re-modelling and re-decorating of the interiors as well as the services of Capability Brown in re-landscaping the park.   The Viscount and Viscountess were thought to be happily married and produced five daughters: Isabella, Francis, Elizabeth, Harriet and Louisa.  A charming portrait of these delightful girls at play can be seen at the top of the Oak Staircase at Temple Newsam House.  In addition a portrait of Isabella (ticket nos. 198) can be found in the South Bedroom and in the State Bedroom there is another portrait of Isabella (ticket no. 365) along with a portrait of Elizabeth (ticket no. 364).  Charles died in 1778 and the title became extinct as there was no male heir.  Frances continued at Temple Newsam during a long widowhood that was spent implementing continuous change to the house and park and on her new interest in politics.  When Frances died in 1807 Temple Newsam was inherited by Lord Hertford, the husband of her eldest daughter Isabella.  When he died in 1821 Isabella inherited Temple Newsam in her own right."

Currently the portrait hangs in the Picture Gallery (ticket no. 94) at Temple Newsam House.  Sir Arthur bought the property from Ludovic Duke of Lennox who himself had been given Temple Newsam by his cousin James I of England and Scotland.  Believed to be the son of Hugh Ingram a successful haberdasher Sir Arthur carved out his own career in the service of the Crown's chief ministers.  This involved farming the royal monopolies, lending money to ambitious courtiers, equipping exhibitions to the New World and developing real estate.  His notoriety peaked when as Keeper of the Privy Purse he found his business practices and modest origins made him unpopular and forced his resignation.  At this point he focused his career and success in the North. He became Secretary to the Council of the North which was the King's executive body for ruling this area.  Here, Sir Arthur's interest in property persisted and he built Sheriff Hutton (1619) and New Park (1640) as well as a mansion on the site of the former Archbishop's Palace in York.  In between these projects he purchased Temple Newsam which he rebuilt over 20 years and which was only just complete at his death in 1642. From the extensive archives of Sir Arthur?s that have survived, it is possible to identify various people who helped with the redevelopment of Temple Newsam at that time.  They included his nephew and his long-serving steward John Matteson who were his clerk of works.  In addition to other tasks associated with the redevelopment of the house and the administration of the  estate, these men employed various specialists such as Francis Gunby for wood carving and panelling, John Burridge for plasterwork and Thomas Ventris for stonework/carving.  Outside the house the walled ornamental garden to the south of the house, with its raised promenades and classical Banqueting House was laid out by Frenchman Pierre Monjoy.  In addition kitchen gardens, orchards and nurseries were all established.  The archives also indicate that over 40.00 in payments was made around 1638 and 1639 to the artist George Geldorp quite possibly for this portrait.  Sir Arthur was married three times.  Two pictures of his daughter Elizabeth, by his first wife Susan Brown, can be found in the Oak Staircase at Temple Newsam.  Elizabeth married Simon Bennet and became known as Lady Bennet.   Sir Arthur's youngest son from his marriage to second wife Alice Ferrers was known as Sir Thomas Ingram and a portrait of him (ticket no. 42) can be found in the Blue Striped Dressing Room at Temple Newsam.  He married Frances Belasyse the daughter of a Viscount and together they had one child Mary who is thought to be one of the ghosts of Temple Newsam. A portrait of Mary (ticket no. 45) can be seen in the Gothic Room at Temple Newsam.  When Sir Arthur died in 1642 it was his eldest son, Sir Arthur Ingram the younger  born to his first wife Susan Brown that inherited Temple Newsam.  Sir Arthur Ingram the younger was also married twice and had many children the eldest of whom, Thomas Ingram was next to inherit Temple Newsam.  He married Mary Paylor daughter of Sir Watkinson Paylor of Thoralby, Yorkshire.  Mary sadly died in childbirth and when Thomas died in 1660 his brother Henry Ingram inherited Temple Newsam.  A portrait of Henry (ticket no. 6) can be found in the Great Hall at Temple Newsam."

Unfortunately, he was unable to recover his financial situation by taking up the position of Governor of Barbados, which was worth 5000 a year, as he died of smallpox.   The family finances were stretched, not least due to the three 'widows pensions' being claimed by three dowager Viscountesses.

An engraving of Frances before her marriage can be seen in the Lady William Gordon room and a portrait (ticket no. 372) of her can be seen in the State Bedroom.  Lady William's husband, Lord William Gordon, was notorious as a philanderer yet the philanthropic Frances is thought to have extended her charity to sponsoring the education of at least one of her husband's illegitimate children.  Together they had only one daughter Frances Kier Gordon who predeceased her mother.  So it was that in 1841 when Frances died, her nephew Hugo Charles inherited Temple Newsam.  Hugo shared the name of his father Hugo Meynell who was the husband of Frances's sister Elizabeth. Portraits of Elizabeth (ticket no. 364) and her husband Hugo (ticket no, 370) can both be found in the state bedroom.  Portraits of their younger son Admiral Henry Meynell (ticket no. 379) can be found in the Boudoir at Temple Newsam.  Henry had a distinguished naval career and held a number of appointments at the courts of three English Monarchs.  He died in Paris an unmarried man leaving a considerable fortune.
Hugo Charles Meynell now added the name Ingram to his own in order to perpetuate the memory of his mother's family.   Hugo married Georgiana Pigou but they spent little time at Temple Newsam.  The Meynells were celebrated sportsmen and only appeared to be at the estate for the shooting season.  So it was that the estate was run by the stewards who were three generations of the Leather family.  During this period the real potential of the estate began to be developed including mines, forestry and investment in real estate and railways.  The house, when not in use by the owners for entertainment, was a tourist attraction receiving visitors in the summer months.  
In 1869 when Hugo Charles died he was succeeded by his only son Hugo Francis, the last direct descendant of Sir Arthur Ingram.  Portraits of Hugo Francis (ticket nos. 380 &172) can be seen in the Boudoir and Oak Corridor respectively with a further portrait in the State Bedroom.

The Prince felt obliged to offer his former Whig friends a number of Cabinet seats in a new coalition. They refused, hoping that they would be offered the entire government, and insisted on the power to re-appoint the Prince's entire Household. As this would have meant turning out the Hertfords, the Prince refused and instead invited Lord Liverpool to become Premier. This political gamble was undoubtedly the inspiration of the Hertfords, but which proved to be very successful - the Prince never had to call upon the Whigs to form a government. Here, under the canopy of the 'Hertford Nursery', Lady Hertford dangles the Regent over a commode, her son Lord Yarmouth behind, Lord Hertford below. She says 'Really my Love it is impossible to make a Cabinet out of such discordant Materials' pointing to timber blocks: Liverpool's ash, Moira's heart of oak, Grenville's log wood, Castlereagh's Middleburg Yew (reference to Walcheren disaster). Lord Hertford says 'Keep him at play My Dear or we are Lost'.

'The Book' was said to contain highly damaging evidence of the Regent's own immoral behaviour.

The Opposition rallied to the Queen's defence: the eventual vote was lost because of the opposition of the bishops who could not countenance the clause enabling divorce with the possibility of subsequent remarriage. The passage of the bill was the most talked about event in the first year of the king's reign, with the general public entirely on the side of the Queen. In the satire the King reclines, attended by lady friends, with Lady Hertford seen from the rear on the right.

The attribution of authorship is based on the discovery, reported in Country Life, 15 Feb. 1919, p.171 of a lead plaque inscribed with the name of the architect Francis Smith of Warwick and thirteen of the principal tradesmen involved in building and equipping the house, the only furniture maker mentioned is 'Thomas How of Westminster, gentleman, upholsterer'. 

Thomas How was in business at Jarman Street, corner of Duke Street, Westminster 1710-33; he provided luxurious furnishings, including a State Bed to the 5th Earl of Salisbury at Hatfield House, Hertfordshire. 'Verre eglomise' (a peacock's tail surmounted by a coronet) panels on chairs are unprecedented - they may have been conceived as part of a unified room scheme which included matching pier glasses and tables. Gilt-lead applied ornament is also rare on furniture of this date. 

The Sutton Scarsdale papers have not survived and the house in now a roofless ruin; Pevsner stated that it was 'easily the grandest mansion of its date in the county'. To see some of the sumptuous interior decoration one must visit the Philadelphia Museum of Art which acquired the Oak Room. The suite of twelve chairs are described in The Reminiscences of Lady Dorothy Nevill (ed. Ralph Nevill), 1906, pp.228-30, as having passed into the hands of an American collector.

This now famous suite is next heard of when it was partly destroyed in a fire at the Brussels International Exhibition, 1910. They were in a period room re-created by White, Allom & Co. of 15 George Street, London who specialised in both reproductions and antiques. White, Allom & Co. commissioned copies to make good their loss and for general sale. The suite, or what remained of it, is next heard of when it was again damaged in a fire at the 5th Avenue, New York, apartment of Mrs Annie C. Kane in August 1921.

The suite seems originally to have consisted of twelve chairs (four of which were lost in the Brussels fire), two settees and a pair of pedestals. The surviving examples appear to be: a pair of chairs at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (incised X & I); a pair of chairs in the Frick collection, New York (VIII & XII); a chair at the Cooper-Hewitt Museum (IV); a pair of chairs at Temple Newsam (VII & IX); one pedestal at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

In terms of overall design the closed analogy is a mahogany writing cabinet which also incorporates storage space in the thickness of the doors and is profusely enriched with brass-inlay but displays carved corner ornaments rather than luxurious mounts. 

The inlaid decoration reflects a slightly old-fashioned, Continental baroque style characteristic of Jean Berain, although no engraved source for the ornament has yet been identified. The gilt brass mounts seem to be related to rococo modelling on silver of the late 1730s and early 40s, and early designs by Cuvilles or the work of Kandler could have inspired certain elements. Dr. Charles Avery has established that the brass Bacchus figure on the cabinet was cast from a bronze which the Florentine sculptor, Massimiliano Soldani supplied to the Prince of Liechtenstein in 1702; he believes that both statuettes are based on Soldani bronzes after antique and 'old master' models.

Old Ochtertyre House, Perthshire, was demolished and rebuilt in the neo-classical taste by Sir William Murray, 1784-90. Household inventories of 1763, 1800 and 1861 survive (N. L. S. Murray of Ochtertyre papers) but contain no record of this writing cabinet, so the Murray's may have inherited rather than commissioned it.

This method was traditionally used to make straw beehives!   The straw base was lined with a layer of fur, and then covered with striped cotton ticking fabric.

Mrs Webster's Family Encyclopaedia, c.1836, stated ""The beehive chair made of straw, has long been used in Wales and Scotland, as well as some places in the north of England; but it is only of late that they have appeared among our fashionable furniture.  They are, however, warm and cheap, and are admired by some persons for their simple, homely and snug appearance"".

DD54) 'a large mahogany library table with carved mouldings and doors and shelves on one side and drawers on the other and covered with green cloth'. About thirty years later an amateur watercolourist depicted the interior of the Library, in which this table is clearly recognisable. The Library is a richly styled architectural room created by York craftsmen in 1744-5, probably to designs by Daniel Garrett. The rhythm and detailing of the table are so closely allied to decorative features in this interior that Garrett may even have designed the table himself. Both on historical and stylistic grounds there are good reasons to attribute the library table to William Hallett; Arthur, 6th Viscount Irwin of Temple Newsam, is his earliest recorded patron having commissioned a number of pieces from the firm in 1735 for his London house ('Connoisseur', Dec. 1964, pp.224-5), the table also bears interesting affinities with the only known piece of cabinet furniture signed by Hallett, including identical lifting handles of a ribbed swag pattern (Gilbert, 'Pictorial Dictionary, fig.463).

The bed came from North Shields, Northumberland, and was described in a will of 1848 as a ""four post Bedstead, Straw and Hair mattress with blue hangings, large feather bed bolster and six pillows"".  This type of bed was quite common at the time. Often the curtains and canopy were made all in one piece, but it is possible that this bed had separate curtains which have since been lost.

Households in the North East clearly regarded beds as an important status symbol, so this example is a valuable social document which also reflects a strong local quilting tradition.

It was around this time that the Prince began his friendship with Lady Hertford which was to be the (unjustified) subject of much popular satire and scandal.

The subjects are taken from the Life of Moses; up to eight or nine different scenes could be ordered, either separately or as a complete series, from the workshops of the weavers, the van der Borchts in Brussels.  The cartoons were probably designed by Jan van Orley (1665-1735) (figures) and Augustin Coppens (1668-1740) (landscapes).  Van Orley perhaps worked from his brother Richard's book illustrations for the 1701 Brussels edition of Josephus' ""L'Histoire des Juifs"", themselves probably influenced by a set of Moses tapestries woven at the Gobelins factory after designs by Poussin and Le Brun.

So far the earliest recorded tapestries from the van Orley cartoons are the five woven by Frans and Pieter van der Borcht for the Stadhuys in Maastricht in 1737-38 (two years after van Orley's death).  The most complete set appears to be the six in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna.

The cartoons were passed down through various members of the van der Borcht family to Jacob the Younger who died in 1794.  It is unclear when the Temple Newsam pair were woven but the unusual border design suggests an early date during the life of the cartoons.  Another tapestry with the same border is known with a scene derived from Teniers.

The Battle of the Israelites and the Amalekites took place during the Exodus from Egypt when:
""...it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed.  But Moses' hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.  And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.""

The tapestries have hung in the Terrace Room probably since 1806, but certainly since 1827 when the room was re-decorated.  Originally they had heavy oak and gilt frames (later re-used as picture frames elsewhere in the house) which probably also surrounded panels of pink silk moire in the chimney alcoves and above the doors.  In 1922 they were removed by Lord Halifax who hung them at the Foreign Office and later at the Embassy in Washington.  He sold them to the antique dealers Frank Partridge & Sons in New York in 1945 who subsequently attempted to sell them at Sotheby's in 1961.

The taste for exact replicas or adaptations of famous antique for modern uses is one of the most characteristic features of Regency silver.  Barnards produced a large number of wine coolers based on the Buckingham Vase and their working drawings show alternative designs for the handles-vine tendrils, or serpents (as here).

The mark on this cup represents the partnership of Rebeccah Emes and Edward Barnard Senior.  The former was the widow of John Emes who died in 1808 whereupon she went into partnership with her husband's former manager Edward Barnard senior until 1829.  Barnard had been apprenticed to Charles Wright and Thomas Chawner before working for Emes.  The firm supplied all the Doncaster Gold Cups between 1821 and 1829, and their Day Book for 10 February 1830 records that they sold '9 Fin'd drawings of Doncaster Cups 1821 to 1829, inclusive to Philip Bright, the retailer in Doncaster High Street, for 4-10s.'

The portrait of Arthur in the Picture Gallery by Leonard Knyff was painted in 1700 at a cost of 30 guineas and gives an indication of the pleasure Arthur took in sports.  However, in addition to sporting and gambling Arthur also under took public duties as an MP twice for Scarborough and as Vice- Admiral for Yorkshire with responsibility for press gangs.  Isabella was the intelligent, sophisticated and accomplished heiress of John Machel of Hills, Sussex.  She also brought two parliamentary seats for Horsham to the marriage thus establishing the political power base for the family that lasted until 1832.  Letters from Arthur to Isabella indicate that theirs was a marriage of affection and during their 16 years together they produced nine sons.   Seven sons survived infancy five of whom succeeded each other as Viscounts.  In order these were; Edward of which there are two portraits  (ticket nos 263 and 269) in the Crimson Bedroom, Rich who married Lady Anne Howard of which there are portraits (ticket nos 265 and 110) in the Crimson Bedroom and Picture Gallery respectively, Arthur of which there is a portrait in the Great Hall, Henry who married Anne Scarborough of whom there is a joint portrait (ticket no. 126) in the Picture Gallery, and George of whom there can also be found a portrait (ticket no. 268) in the Crimson Bedroom.

The Prince Regent (later George IV) had put them into this uniform after the Battle of Waterloo (1815), which he imagined he had won himself.
 
Thomas was the eldest son of Richard Oliver Gascoigne (d.1843) of Parlington Hall, who bought Lotherton in 1825. Richard was very wealthy and gave his son the best possible start to a career in army by purchasing him an officer?s commission in the Royal Horse Guard. However, Thomas never saw active service and predeceased his father in 1842. The following year Lotherton passed to his sisters Mary Isabella (1810-1891) and Elizabeth (1812-1893)."
